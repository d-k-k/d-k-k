* Duties primarily involved creating assignments and quizes; grading of assignments, quizes, projects, and final exam. Hosting review sessions.



## Research


### SAGE2
SAGE2 is a Middleware to drive multiple displays (potentially across different hardware systems) as one unified multi-user environment. The SAGE2 team is constantly investigating how collaboration can be enhanced through digial multiuser workspaces. Topics of investigation include new features, improvements, and mediums to help brainstorming, collaboration, data investigation, and information distribution.

### LandSAGE
LandSAGE is currently in early planning and prototyping stage. We are interested in creating an effective decision support system for monitoring and mitigation of natural disasters with a focus on landslides, mudflows, and floods. Currently the focus is on Southeast Asia counteries which have the expertise and are looking to build a cyber infrastructure to support such a system.

### DynaCOVE
DynaCOVE is funded by a small business innovation research(SBIR) by the Army Research Lab to invesigtate hardware agnostic virtual reality(VR) systems. The project is interested in developing an architecture to support a collaborative multiuser environment with both VR and non-VR clients interacting together.
